      <h2 class="lead col-md-12">While serving the last ten years in technical support, process improvement, and people development roles, it became clear that the rapid advance of technology was forever changing the face of business. </h2>

      <h2 class="lead col-md-12"> I believe in todayâ€™s world, software development and management needs to be a core competency of any growing company.
        I have always had a technical bent and felt that in order to serve organizations best, I needed to build on those innate abilities.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="lead col-md-12">So, driven by a desire to integrate my skills and experience for the greatest impact, I enrolled in an intensive software development boot-camp that would allow me to develop software systems and help people work smarter.</h2>

      <h2 class="lead col-md-12">I have diverse business consulting experience across multiple roles including:
