    <p class="lead">I have diverse business consulting experience across multiple roles including: productivity and performance management, process analysis and improvement, and project management.</p>

    <p> My experience includes work for major retail distribution, direct to consumer, and healthcare. I have a demonstrated ability to lead teams through processes and break the complex down into simple pieces while keeping the end goal in mind. I feel I am a creative problem solver with ability to adapt in fast-paced, changing environments. I am adept at identifying priorities and anticipating hurdles while effectively meeting objectives.</p>

    <p class="lead">Working as a business consultant in so many different areas had me working closely with developers and reignited a passion for technology. I realized the value I could add if I became a software developer who also knew the people and process fundamentals I was working to support.
